                <p class="speaker-name">Dr. Axel Rauschmayer</p>

                <p>Dr. Axel Rauschmayer specializes in JavaScript and web technologies. He blogs at <a href="http://www.2ality.com/">2ality.com</a>, teaches web development for
                    <a href="http://ecmanauten.de/">ecmanauten.de</a> and organizes <a href="http://munichjs.de/">Munich’s JavaScript user group</a>.
                    Axel has been programming since 1985, developing web applications since 1995 and held his first talk on Ajax in 2006.
                    In 1999, he was technical manager at a German internet startup that later expanded internationally.

                <p>
                    With his 15 years of experience he has figured out something about the dos and don'ts of software development.
                    Right now, functional programming seems to be one of the dos, while Javascript remains one of the musts.
                    In particular, Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) seems to be a perfect fit for tackling the problems
                    related to keeping a complex and highly asynchronous application codebase nice and readable.

                    Juha is the author of <a href="http://baconjs.github.io/">Bacon.js</a> - the FRP library for Javascript. He uses it at work every day to create modern web apps for his clients.

                    Gregor is a self-taught web developer with a strong focus on CSS.
                    He works as a front-end developer and architect at <a href="http://sinnerschrader.com">SinnerSchrader</a>.
                    Gregor is very active on <a href="http://codepen.io/pixelass/">codepen</a> where he shows a lot of abstract CSS experiments.
                    While he has no special focus when is comes to CSS his most impressive works are related to 3d shapes or fractals.
                    Gregor speaks at conferences and meetups with a strong urge to teach or help other developers.
                    He pushes his own limits every day, staying up to date with the latest specs, finding fixes for browser quirks or trying to do the impossible.

        <h2>Lightning Talks</h2>
        <p>Want to give a talk, but do not have enough material for a full talk? Have a shout-out for an open source project or tool?
            Want to share a community story (everyone loves stories!)? Preach the must-know fundamentals of Web, JavaScript, CSS, etc?
            Then lightning talks are for you! These talks are, at max, 5 minute talks done in quick succession. No need to fill the whole slot, though!

           We are accepting, reviewing, and selecting proposals for lightning talks in advance.

        <h2>Workshops</h2>
        <p>The Saturday before the main conference will be dedicated to a series of workshops.
            Your ticket for the conference does not grant you admission to the workshops.
            Space being limited, please only register if you are sure to attend.
            Please, sign up for updates to receive a notification when registration will start.</p>
        <p>Planned workshops:</p>

                <p class="speaker-name">WebGL via Martin Naumann</p>

                <p>The web is transforming into a more interactive, more powerful platform every day.</p>
<p>Yet we’re rarely using its full potential – for instance by using impressive and powerful 3D visualisations to convey better visual representations.</p>
<p>In this workshop I will show a few case studies using WebGL for data visualisation of source code repositories, interactive models of apartments with realistic furniture, traffic visualisation.</p>
<p>The workshop will also talk about potential pitfalls and performance bottlenecks and how to overcome them – using Three.js as an example.</p>

                <img class="speaker-photo" src="images/workshops/nodejs.png"
                     alt="Polymer logo"/>
                <p class="speaker-name">Node.js via Andrei Listochkin</p>
                <p>Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

                     alt="ReactJS logo"/>
                <p class="speaker-name">ReactJS via Viktor Khomyakov</p>

                <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</p>
<p>Just the UI: Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project.</p>
<p>Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM diff implementation for ultra-high performance. It can also render on the server using Node.js — no heavy browser DOM required.</p>
<p>Data flow: React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.</p>
<p>Viktor teaches you how to use React in your own project.</p>
